While I am doing my homework, I like to have the following snacks:

- Humus, accompanied with:
  - crackers
  - mini carrots
  - sliced bread
- Brie cheese, accompanied with:
  - crackers
  - bread
- And my less healthy snacks would be:
  - ice cream
  - chocolate

However, I am not a fan of insects, and when doing my assignment \#2 and saw the images contained in the GitHub repository, like this:

 ![hairy insect](images/Rhytidoponera_metallica.jpg) 

**AND I LOST MY APPETITE!** (not really, I am just being dramatic)

Anyway, this is how you make a table using Markdown:


This | is | a | table | header
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Humus | crackers| Brie cheese|mini carrots| ice cream
1 | 2 | 3 | 4|5
